# Notes 
**What one's OS should support**
* Independance of package managers or "chose your own favority apt"
* Musl and Glibc
* runit vs OpenRC
* Run from RAM
* Busybox as base
* Dracut? Or other way of creating initramfs
* U-Boot vs GRUB2 (even Syslinux or its included?)
* Clear & simple boot process breakdown and f*cking explanation. No more hell..
* DTb/s/i
* Support for difference architectures. Infrastructure should be the same of on different plantforms
* Certainly explained how to compile/assemble everything manually (like a manual if you want to do the same)
